Usage: $('#control_id').multiSelect( options, callback )

Options:  selectAll          - whether or not to display the Select All option; true/false, default = true
          selectAllText      - text to display for selecting/unselecting all options simultaneously
          noneSelected       - text to display when there are no selected items in the list
          oneOrMoreSelected  - text to display when there are one or more selected items in the list
                               (note: you can use % as a placeholder for the number of items selected).
                               Use * to show a comma separated list of all selected; default = '% selected'
          focusTimeout       - time until the expanded options disappear after losing focus
                               (note: you can specify false, so there won't be any timeout)
